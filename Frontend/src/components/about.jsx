          <h3 className="about-subheader">Our Mission</h3>
          <p>
            At GreenGen, our mission is to revolutionize the agricultural supply
            chain by connecting farmers directly with consumers. We aim to
            provide a platform that ensures fair pricing, transparency, and
            sustainability, promoting the best practices in agriculture.
          </p>

          <h3 className="about-subheader">Our Vision</h3>
          <p>
            We envision a world where every farmer has direct access to the
            marketplace, and every consumer has access to fresh, locally sourced
            produce. We strive to eliminate middlemen, reduce food wastage, and
            ensure that the benefits of the agricultural trade reach those who
            deserve them the most â€“ the farmers.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Integrity:</strong> We believe in doing the right thing, always.
            <br />
